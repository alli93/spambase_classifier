###### kNN ########

'n_components'
(pca) Explained variance ratio plot. We reach 95% explained variance
with 48 components.

'hypertune_n_components'
Cross-validation to find out the optimal number of components. Testing shows
it's 20. Or 14 using precision.

'Hypertune_kNearest_1'
Cross-validation on n_neighbors parameter for kNN. We test values
between 1 and 30. Looking at the plot we surmize that the optimal
value of n_neighbors is somewhere between 10 and 25

'Hypertune_kNearest_2'
Testing values between 10 and 25. 13 is the optimal value for n_neighbors.
Using precision, 4 is the optimal number.

'kNN_model_comparison'
Comparison of our reduced and hypertuned model with a non-reduced, non-hypertuned one.
n_components = 14
n_neighbors = 4

### mNB #######

'multinomialBayes_preprocessing'
Comparison of accuracy from different preprocessings. The preprocessings
we test are no-preprocessing, normalized and upscaled, and finally normalized
and then scaled between [0, 1]

'multinomialBayes_hypertune'
Hypertuning for alpha. We find lidstone smoothing with a small
alpha value to give best results

'multinomialBayes_final'
Comparison of our model with a non-preprocessed, non-hypertuned model. alpha value is 0.01. Or any small value < 1.
