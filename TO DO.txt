FINAL Comments:
- n-components.png, mNB_model_comparison_precision.png, kNN_model_comparison_precision.png figures are cut off a bit (left label is not properly visible)

- CHANGE label on Hypertune_kNearest_recall.png (x-axis should just be k not KNearest)

- code in latex



TO DO:

- PCA (principal component analysis) (because of knn!)
-- evaluation of PCA
- knn
- hypertuning (read up on hyper tuning in general)
- neural networks
- bayesian for continuous variables
- FALSE NEGATIVES!!!


QUESTIONS:
- should we do PCA before splitting the data? (We think yes :))
